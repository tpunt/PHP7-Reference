## Performance

Unarguably the greatest part about PHP 7 is the incredible performance boosts
it provides to applications. This is a result of refactoring the Zend Engine to
use more compact data structures and less heap allocations/deallocations.

The performance gains on real world applications will vary, though many
applications seem to receive a ~100% performance boost - with lower memory
consumption too!

The refactored codebase provides further opportunities for future optimisations
as well (such as JIT compilation). So it looks like future PHP versions will
continue to see performance enhancements too.

## Features

### Combined Comparison Operator
The combined comparison operator (or spaceship operator) is a shorthand
notation for performing three-way comparisons from two operands. It has an
integer return value that can be either:

* a positive integer (if the left-hand operand is greater than the right-hand operand)
* 0 (if both operands are equal)
* a negative integer (if the right-hand operand is greater than the left-hand operand)

The operator has the same precedence as the equality operators (`==`, `!=`,
`===`, `!==`) and has the exact same behaviour as the other loose comparison
operators (`<`, `>=`, etc). It is also non-associative like them too, so
chaining of the operands (like `1 <=> 2 <=> 3`) is not allowed.

```PHP
// compares strings lexically
var_dump('PHP' <=> 'Node'); // int(1)

// compares numbers by size
var_dump(123 <=> 456); // int(-1)

// compares corresponding array elements with one-another
var_dump(['a', 'b'] <=> ['a', 'b']); // int(0)
```

Objects are not comparable, and so using them as operands with this operator
will result in undefined behaviour.

RFC: [Combined Comparison Operator](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/combined-comparison-operator)

### Null Coalesce Operator
The null coalesce operator (or isset ternary operator) is a shorthand notation
for performing `isset()` checks in the ternary operator. This is a common thing
to do in applications, and so a new syntax has been introduced for this exact
purpose.

```PHP
// Pre PHP 7 code
$route = isset($_GET['route']) ? $_GET['route'] : 'index';

// PHP 7+ code
$route = $_GET['route'] ?? 'index';
```

RFC: [Null Coalesce Operator](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/isset_ternary)

### Scalar Type Declarations
Scalar type declarations come in two flavours: **coercive** (default) and
**strict**. The following types for parameters can now be enforced (either
coercively or strictly): strings (`string`), integers (`int`), floating-point
numbers (`float`), and booleans (`bool`). They augment the other types
introduced in the PHP 5.x versions: class names, interfaces, `array` and
`callable`.

```PHP
// Coercive mode
function sumOfInts(int ...$ints)
{
    return array_sum($ints);
}

var_dump(sumOfInts(2, '3', 4.1)); // int(9)
```

To enable strict mode, a `declare()` directive must be the first statement of
a script. The strict mode will apply to the entire script. This directive not
only affects the type declarations of parameters, but also a function's return
type (see [Return Type Declarations](#return-type-declarations)), built-in PHP
functions, and functions from loaded extensions.

If the type-check fails, then a `TypeError` exception (see [Exceptions in the
Engine](#exceptions-in-the-engine)) is thrown. The only leniency present in
strict typing is the automatic conversion of integers to floats (but not
vice-versa) when an integer is provided in a float context.

```PHP
declare(strict_types=1);

function multiply(float $x, float $y)
{
    return $x * $y;
}

function add(int $x, int $y)
{
    return $x + $y;
}

var_dump(multiply(2, 3.5)); // float(7)
var_dump(add('2', 3)); // Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: Argument 1 passed to add() must be of the type integer, string given...
```

Note that **only** the *invocation context* applies when the type-checking is
performed. This means that the strict typing applies only to function/method
calls, and not to the function/method definitions. In the above example, the
two functions could have been declared in either a strict or coercive file, but
so long as they're being called in a strict file, then the strict typing rules
will apply.

**BC Breaks**
 - Classes with names `int`, `string`, `float`, and `bool` are now forbidden.

RFC: [Scalar Type Declarations](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/scalar_type_hints_v5)

### Return Type Declarations
Return type declarations enable for the return type of a function, method, or
closure to be specified. The following return types are supported: `string`,
`int`, `float`, `bool`, `array`, `callable`, `self` (methods only), `parent`
(methods only), `Closure`, the name of a class, and the name of an interface.

```PHP
function arraysSum(array ...$arrays): array
{
    return array_map(function(array $array): int {
        return array_sum($array);
    }, $arrays);
}

print_r(arraysSum([1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]));
/* Output
Array
(
    [0] => 6
    [1] => 15
    [2] => 24
)
*/
```

With respect to subtyping, **invariance** has been chosen for return types.
This simply means that when a method is either overridden in a subtyped class
or implemented as defined in a contract, its return type must match exactly the
method it is (re)implementing.

```PHP
class A {}
class B extends A {}

class C
{
    public function test() : A
    {
        return new A;
    }
}

class D extends C
{
    // overriding method C::test() : A
    public function test() : B // Fatal error due to variance mismatch
    {
        return new B;
    }
}
```

The overriding method `D::test() : B` causes an `E_COMPILE_ERROR` because
covariance is not allowed. In order for this to work, `D::test()` method must
have a return type of `A`.

```PHP
class A {}

interface SomeInterface
{
    public function test() : A;
}

class B implements SomeInterface
{
    public function test() : A // all good!
    {
        return null; // Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: Return value of B::test() must be an instance of A, null returned...
    }
}
```

This time, the implemented method causes a `TypeError` exception (see
[Exceptions in the Engine](#exceptions-in-the-engine)) to be thrown when
executed. This is because `null` is not a valid return type - only an instance of the
class `A` can be returned.

RFC: [Return Type Declarations](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/return_types)

### Anonymous Classes

Anonymous classes are useful when simple, one-off objects need to be created.

```PHP
// Pre PHP 7 code
class Logger
{
    public function log($msg)
    {
        echo $msg;
    }
}

$util->setLogger(new Logger());

// PHP 7+ code
$util->setLogger(new class {
    public function log($msg)
    {
        echo $msg;
    }
});
```

They can pass arguments through to their constructors, extend other classes,
implement interfaces, and use traits just like a normal class can:
```PHP
class SomeClass {}
interface SomeInterface {}
trait SomeTrait {}

var_dump(new class(10) extends SomeClass implements SomeInterface {
    private $num;

    public function __construct($num)
    {
        $this->num = $num;
    }

    use SomeTrait;
});

/** Output:
object(class@anonymous)#1 (1) {
  ["Command line code0x104c5b612":"class@anonymous":private]=>
  int(10)
}
*/
```

Nesting an anonymous class within another class does not give it access to any
private or protected methods or properties of that outer class. In order to use
the outer class' protected properties or methods, the anonymous class can
extend the outer class. To use the private or protected properties of the outer
class in the anonymous class, they must be passed through its constructor:
```PHP
<?php

class Outer
{
    private $prop = 1;
    protected $prop2 = 2;

    protected function func1()
    {
        return 3;
    }

    public function func2()
    {
        return new class($this->prop) extends Outer {
            private $prop3;

            public function __construct($prop)
            {
                $this->prop3 = $prop;
            }

            public function func3()
            {
                return $this->prop2 + $this->prop3 + $this->func1();
            }
        };
    }
}

echo (new Outer)->func2()->func3(); // 6
```

RFC: [Anonymous Classes](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/anonymous_classes)

### Unicode Codepoint Escape Syntax

This enables a UTF-8 encoded unicode codepoint to be output in either a
double-quoted string or a heredoc. Any valid codepoint is accepted, with
leading `0`'s being optional.

```PHP
echo "\u{aa}"; // ª
echo "\u{0000aa}"; // ª (same as before but with optional leading 0's)
echo "\u{9999}"; // 香
```

RFC: [Unicode Codepoint Escape Syntax](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/unicode_escape)

### Closure call() Method

The new `call()` method for closures is used as a shorthand way of invoking a
closure whilst binding an object scope to it. This creates more perfomant and
compact code by removing the need to create an intermediate closure before
invoking it.

```PHP
class A {private $x = 1;}

// Pre PHP 7 code
$getXCB = function() {return $this->x;};
$getX = $getXCB->bindTo(new A, 'A'); // intermediate closure
echo $getX(); // 1

// PHP 7+ code
$getX = function() {return $this->x;};
echo $getX->call(new A); // 1
```

RFC: [Closure::call](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/closure_apply)

### Filtered `unserialize()`

This feature seeks to provide better security when unserializing objects on
untrusted data. It prevents possible code injections by enabling the developer
to whitelist classes that can be unserialized.

```PHP
// converts all objects into __PHP_Incomplete_Class object
$data = unserialize($foo, ["allowed_classes" => false]);

// converts all objects into __PHP_Incomplete_Class object except those of MyClass and MyClass2
$data = unserialize($foo, ["allowed_classes" => ["MyClass", "MyClass2"]);

// default behaviour (same as omitting the second argument) that accepts all classes
$data = unserialize($foo, ["allowed_classes" => true]);
```

RFC: [Filtered unserialize()](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/secure_unserialize)

### `IntlChar` Class

The new `IntlChar` class seeks to expose additional ICU functionality. The
class itself defines a number of static methods and constants that can be used
to manipulate unicode characters.

```PHP
printf('%x', IntlChar::CODEPOINT_MAX); // 10ffff
echo IntlChar::charName('@'); // COMMERCIAL AT
var_dump(IntlChar::ispunct('!')); // bool(true)
```

In order to use this class, the `Intl` extension must be installed.

**BC Breaks**
 - Classes in the global namespace must not be called `IntlChar`.

RFC: [IntlChar class](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/intl.char)

### Expectations

Expectations are backwards compatible enhancement to the older `assert()`
function. They enable for zero-cost assertions in production code, and provide
the ability to throw custom exceptions on error.

The `assert()` function's prototype is as follows:
```
void assert (mixed $expression [, mixed $message]);
```

As with the old API, if `$expression` is a string, then it will be evaluated.
If the first argument is falsy, then the assertion fails. The second argument
can either be a plain string (causing an AssertionError to be triggered),
or a custom exception object containing an error message.

```PHP
ini_set('assert.exception', 1);

class CustomError extends AssertionError {}

assert(false, new CustomError('Some error message'));
```

With this feature comes two PHP.ini settings (along with their default values):
 - zend.assertions = 1
 - assert.exception = 0

**zend.assertions** has three values:
 - **1** = generate and execute code (development mode)
 - **0** = generate code and jump around at it at runtime
 - **-1** = don't generate any code (zero-cost, production mode)

**assert.exception** means that an exception is thrown when an assertion fails.
This is switched off by default to remain compatible with the old `assert()`
function.

RFC: [Expectations](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/expectations)

### Group `use` Declarations

This gives the ability to group multiple `use` declarations according to the
parent namespace. This seeks to remove code verbosity when importing multiple
classes, functions, or constants that come under the same namespace.

```PHP
// Pre PHP 7 code
use some\namespace\ClassA;
use some\namespace\ClassB;
use some\namespace\ClassC as C;

use function some\namespace\fn_a;
use function some\namespace\fn_b;
use function some\namespace\fn_c;

use const some\namespace\ConstA;
use const some\namespace\ConstB;
use const some\namespace\ConstC;

// PHP 7+ code
use some\namespace\{ClassA, ClassB, ClassC as C};
use function some\namespace\{fn_a, fn_b, fn_c};
use const some\namespace\{ConstA, ConstB, ConstC};
```

RFC: [Group use Declarations](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/group_use_declarations)

### Generator Return Expressions

This feature builds upon the generator functionality introduced into PHP 5.5.
It enables for a `return` statement to be used within a generator to enable for
a final *expression* to be returned (return by reference is not allowed). This
value can be fetched using the new `Generator::getReturn()` method, which may
only be used once the generator has finishing yielding values.

```PHP
// IIFE syntax now possible - see the Uniform Variable Syntax subsection in the Changes section
$gen = (function() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;

    return 3;
})();

foreach ($gen as $val) {
    echo $val, PHP_EOL;
}

echo $gen->getReturn(), PHP_EOL;

// output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
```

Being able to explicitly return a final value from a generator is a handy
ability to have. This is because it enables for a final value to be returned by
a generator (from perhaps some form of coroutine computation) that can be
specifically handled by the client code executing the generator. This is far
simpler than forcing the client code to firstly check whether the final value
has been yielded, and then if so, to handle that value specifically.

RFC: [Generator Return Expressions](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/generator-return-expressions)

### Generator Delegation

Generator delegation builds upon the ability of being able to return
expressions from generators. It does this by using an new syntax of `yield from
<expr>`, where <expr> can be any `Traversable` object or array. This <expr>
will be advanced until no longer valid, and then execution will continue in the
calling generator. This feature enables `yield` statements to be broken down
into smaller operations, thereby promoting cleaner code that has greater
reusability.

```PHP
function gen()
{
    yield 1;
    yield 2;

    return yield from gen2();
}

function gen2()
{
    yield 3;

    return 4;
}

$gen = gen();

foreach ($gen as $val)
{
    echo $val, PHP_EOL;
}

echo $gen->getReturn();

// output
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
```

RFC: [Generator Delegation](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/generator-delegation)

### Integer Division with `intdiv()`

The `intdiv()` function has been introduced to handle division where an integer is to be returned.

```PHP
var_dump(intdiv(10, 3)); // int(3)
```

**BC Breaks**
 - Functions in the global namespace must not be called `intdiv`.

RFC: [intdiv()](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/intdiv)

### `session_start()` Options

This feature gives the ability to pass in an array of options to the
`session_start()` function. This is used to set session-based php.ini options:

```PHP
session_start(['cache_limiter' => 'private']); // sets the session.cache_limiter option to private
```

This feature also introduces a new php.ini setting (`session.lazy_write`) that
is, by default, set to true and means that session data is only rewritten if it
changes.

RFC: [Introduce session_start() Options](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/session-lock-ini)

### `preg_replace_callback_array()` Function

This new function enables code to be written more cleanly when using the
`preg_replace_callback()` function. Prior to PHP 7, callbacks that needed to be
executed per regular expression required the callback function (second
parameter of `preg_replace_callback()`) to be polluted with lots of branching
(a hacky method at best).

Now, callbacks can be registered to each regular expression using an associative
array, where the key is a regular expression and the value is a callback.

Function Signature:
```
string preg_replace_callback_array(array $regexesAndCallbacks, string $input);
```

```PHP
$tokenStream = []; // [tokenName, lexeme] pairs

$input = <<<'end'
$a = 3; // variable initialisation
end;

// Pre PHP 7 code
preg_replace_callback(
    [
        '~\$[a-z_][a-z\d_]*~i',
        '~=~',
        '~[\d]+~',
        '~;~',
        '~//.*~'
    ],
    function ($match) use (&$tokenStream) {
        if (strpos($match[0], '$') === 0) {
            $tokenStream[] = ['T_VARIABLE', $match[0]];
        } elseif (strpos($match[0], '=') === 0) {
            $tokenStream[] = ['T_ASSIGN', $match[0]];
        } elseif (ctype_digit($match[0])) {
            $tokenStream[] = ['T_NUM', $match[0]];
        } elseif (strpos($match[0], ';') === 0) {
            $tokenStream[] = ['T_TERMINATE_STMT', $match[0]];
        } elseif (strpos($match[0], '//') === 0) {
            $tokenStream[] = ['T_COMMENT', $match[0]];
        }
    },
    $input
);

// PHP 7+ code
preg_replace_callback_array(
    [
        '~\$[a-z_][a-z\d_]*~i' => function ($match) use (&$tokenStream) {
            $tokenStream[] = ['T_VARIABLE', $match[0]];
        },
        '~=~' => function ($match) use (&$tokenStream) {
            $tokenStream[] = ['T_ASSIGN', $match[0]];
        },
        '~[\d]+~' => function ($match) use (&$tokenStream) {
            $tokenStream[] = ['T_NUM', $match[0]];
        },
        '~;~' => function ($match) use (&$tokenStream) {
            $tokenStream[] = ['T_TERMINATE_STMT', $match[0]];
        },
        '~//.*~' => function ($match) use (&$tokenStream) {
            $tokenStream[] = ['T_COMMENT', $match[0]];
        }
    ],
    $input
);
```

**BC Breaks**
 - Functions in the global namespace must not be called `preg_replace_callback_array`.

RFC: [Add preg_replace_callback_array Function](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/preg_replace_callback_array)

### CSPRNG Functions

This feature introduces two new functions for generating cryptographically
secure integers and strings. They expose simple APIs and are
platform-independent.

Function signatures:
```
string random_bytes(int length);
int random_int(int min, int max);
```

Both functions will emit an `Error` exception if a source of sufficient
randomness cannot be found.

**BC Breaks**
 - Functions in the global namespace must not be called `random_int` or `random_bytes`.

RFC: [Easy User-land CSPRNG](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/easy_userland_csprng)

### Support for Array Constants in `define()`

The ability to define array constants was introduced in PHP 5.6 using the
`const` keyword. This ability has now been applied to the `define()` function
too:

```PHP
define('ALLOWED_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS', ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif', 'png']);
```

RFC: no RFC available

### Reflection Additions

Two new reflection classes have been introduced in PHP 7. The first is
`ReflectionGenerator`, which is used for introspection on generators:

```PHP
class ReflectionGenerator
{
    public __construct(Generator $gen)
    public array getTrace($options = DEBUG_BACKTRACE_PROVIDE_OBJECT)
    public int getExecutingLine(void)
    public string getExecutingFile(void)
    public ReflectionFunctionAbstract getFunction(void)
    public Object getThis(void)
    public Generator getExecutingGenerator(void)
}
```

The second is `ReflectionType` to better support the scalar and return type
declaration features:

```PHP
class ReflectionType
{
    public bool allowsNull(void)
    public bool isBuiltin(void)
    public string __toString(void)
}
```

Also, two new methods have been introduced into `ReflectionParameter`:
```PHP
class ReflectionParameter
{
    // ...
    public bool hasType(void)
    public ReflectionType getType(void)
}
```

As well as two new methods in `ReflectionFunctionAbstract`:
```PHP
class ReflectionFunctionAbstract
{
    // ...
    public bool hasReturnType(void)
    public ReflectionType getReturnType(void)
}
```

**BC Breaks**
 - Classes in the global namespace must not be called `ReflectionGenerator` or
   `ReflectionType`.

RFC: no RFC available

## Changes

### Loosening Reserved Word Restrictions

Globally reserved words as property, constant, and method names within classes,
interfaces, and traits are now allowed. This reduces the surface of BC breaks
when new keywords are introduced and avoids naming restrictions on APIs.

This is particularly useful when creating internal DSLs with fluent interfaces:
```PHP
// 'new', 'private', and 'for' were previously unusable
Project::new('Project Name')->private()->for('purpose here')->with('username here');
```

The only limitation is that the `class` keyword still cannot be used as a
constant name, otherwise it would conflict with the class name resolution
syntax (`ClassName::class`).

RFC: [Context Sensitive Lexer](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/context_sensitive_lexer)

### Uniform Variable Syntax

This change brings far greater orthogonality to the variable operators in PHP.
It enables for a number of new combinations of operators that were previously
disallowed, and so introduces new ways to achieve old operations in terser
code.

```PHP
// nesting ::
$foo::$bar::$baz // access the property $baz of the $foo::$bar property

// nesting ()
foo()() // invoke the return of foo()

// operators on expressions enclosed in ()
(function () {})() // IIFE syntax from JS
```

The ability to arbitrarily combine variable operators came from reversing the
evaluation semantics of indirect variable, property, and method references. The
new behaviour is more intuitive and always follows a left-to-right evaluation
order:

```PHP
                        // old meaning            // new meaning
$$foo['bar']['baz']     ${$foo['bar']['baz']}     ($$foo)['bar']['baz']
$foo->$bar['baz']       $foo->{$bar['baz']}       ($foo->$bar)['baz']
$foo->$bar['baz']()     $foo->{$bar['baz']}()     ($foo->$bar)['baz']()
Foo::$bar['baz']()      Foo::{$bar['baz']}()      (Foo::$bar)['baz']()
```

**BC Breaks**
 - Code that relied upon the old evaluation order must be rewritten to
   explicitly use that evaluation order with curly braces (see middle column of
the above). This will make the code both forwards compatible with PHP 7.x and
backwards compatible with PHP 5.x

### Exceptions in the Engine

Exceptions in the engine converts many fatal and recoverable fatal errors into
exceptions. This enables for graceful degradation of applications through
custom error handling procedures. It also means that cleanup-driven features
such as the `finally` clause and object destructors will now be executed.
Furthermore, by using exceptions for application errors, stack traces will be
produced for additional debugging information.

```PHP
function sum(float ...$numbers) : float
{
    return array_sum($numbers);
}

try {
    $total = sum(3, 4, null);
} catch (TypeError $typeErr) {
    // handle type error here
}
```

The new exception hierarchy is as follows:
```
interface Throwable
    |- Exception implements Throwable
        |- ...
    |- Error implements Throwable
        |- TypeError extends Error
        |- ParseError extends Error
        |- AssertionError extends Error
        |- ArithmeticError extends Error
            |- DivisionByZeroError extends ArithmeticError
```

See the [Throwable Interface](#throwable-interface) subsection in the Changes
section for more information on this new exception hierarchy.

**BC Breaks**
 - Custom error handlers used for handling (and typically ignoring) recoverable
   fatal errors will not longer work since exceptions will now be thrown
 - Parse errors occurring in `eval()`ed code will now become exceptions,
   requiring them to be wrapped in a `try...catch` block

RFC: [Exceptions in the Engine](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_exceptions_for_php7)

### Throwable Interface

This change affects PHP's exception hierarchy due to the introduction of
[exceptions in the engine](#exceptions-in-the-engine). Rather than placing
fatal and recoverable fatal errors under the pre-existing `Exception` class
hierarchy, [it was
decided](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_exceptions_for_php7#doodle__form__introduce_and_use_baseexception)
to implement a new hierarchy of exceptions to prevent PHP 5.x code from
catching these new exceptions with catch-all (`catch (Exception $e)`) clauses.

The new exception hierarchy is as follows:
```
interface Throwable
    |- Exception implements Throwable
        |- ...
    |- Error implements Throwable
        |- TypeError extends Error
        |- ParseError extends Error
        |- AssertionError extends Error
        |- ArithmeticError extends Error
            |- DivisionByZeroError extends ArithmeticError
```

The `Throwable` interface is implemented by both `Exception` and `Error` base
class hierarchies and defines the following contract:
```
interface Throwable
{
    final public string getMessage ( void )
    final public mixed getCode ( void )
    final public string getFile ( void )
    final public int getLine ( void )
    final public array getTrace ( void )
    final public string getTraceAsString ( void )
    public string __toString ( void )
}
```

`Throwable` cannot be implemented by user-defined classes - instead, a custom
exception class should extend one of the pre-existing exceptions classes in
PHP.

RFC: [Throwable Interface](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/throwable-interface)

### Integer Semantics

The semantics for some integer-based behaviour has changed in an effort to make
them more intuitive and platform-independent. Here is a list of those changes:
 - Casting `NAN` and `INF` to an integer will always result in 0
 - Bitwise shifting by a negative number of bits is now disallowed (causes a
   bool(false) return and emits an E_WARNING)
 - Left bitwise shifts by a number of bits beyond the bit width of an integer will always result in 0
 - Right bitwise shifts by a number of bits beyond the bit width of an integer
   will always result in 0 or -1 (sign dependent)

**BC Breaks**
 - Any reliance on the old semantics for the above will no longer work

RFC: [Integer Semantics](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/integer_semantics)

### JSON Extension Replaced with JSOND

The licensing of the old JSON extension was regarded as non-free, causing
issues for many Linux-based distributions. The extension has since been
replaced with JSOND and comes with some [performance
gains](https://github.com/bukka/php-jsond-bench/blob/master/reports/0001/summary.md)
and backward compatibility breakages.

**BC Breaks**
 - A number *must not* end in a decimal point (i.e. `34.` must be changed to either `34.0` or just `34`)
 - The `e` exponent *must not* immediately follow the decimal point (i.e.
   `3.e3` must be changed to either `3.0e3` or just `3e3`)

RFC: [Replace current json extension with jsond](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jsond)

### ZPP Failure on Overflow

Coercion between floats to integers can occur when a float is passed to an
internal function expecting an integer. If the float is too large to represent
as an integer, then the value will be silently truncated (which may result in a
loss of magnitude and sign). This can introduce hard-to-find bugs. This change
therefore seeks to notify the developer when an implicit conversion from a
float to an integer has occurred and failed by returning `null` and emitting an
E_WARNING.

**BC Breaks**
 - Code that once silently worked will now emit an E_WARNING and may fail if
   the result of the function invocation is directly passed to another function
(since `null` will now be passed in).

RFC: [ZPP Failure on Overflow](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/zpp_fail_on_overflow)

### Fixes to `foreach()`'s Behaviour

PHP's `foreach()` loop had a number of strange edge-cases to it. These were all
implementation-driven and caused a lot of undefined and inconsistent behaviour
when iterating between copies and references of an array, when using iterator
manipulators like `current()` and `reset()`, when modifying the array currently
being iterated, and so on.

This change eliminates the undefined behaviour of these edge-cases and makes
the semantics more predictable and intuitive.

`foreach()` by value on arrays
```PHP
$array = [1,2,3];
$array2 = &$array;

foreach($array as $val) {
    unset($array[1]); // modify array being iterated over
    echo "{$val} - ", current($array), PHP_EOL;
}

// Pre PHP 7 result
1 - 3
3 -

// PHP 7+ result
1 - 1
2 - 1
3 - 1
```

When by-value semantics are used, the array being iterated over is now not
modified in-place. `current()` also now has defined behaviour, where it will
always begin at the start of the array.

`foreach()` by reference on arrays and objects and by value on objects
```PHP
$array = [1,2,3];

foreach($array as &$val) {
    echo "{$val} - ", current($array), PHP_EOL;
}

// Pre PHP 7 result
1 - 2
2 - 3
3 -

// PHP 7+ result
1 - 1
2 - 1
3 - 1
```

The `current()` function is no longer affected by `foreach()`'s iteration on
the array. Also, nested `foreach()`'s using by-reference semantics work
independently from each other now:
```PHP
$array = [1,2,3];

foreach($array as &$val) {
    echo $val, PHP_EOL;

    foreach ($array as &$val2) {
        unset($array[1]);
        echo $val, PHP_EOL;
    }
}

// Pre PHP 7 result
1
1
1

// PHP 7+ result
1
1
1
3
3
3
```

**BC Breaks**
 - Any reliance on the old (quirky and undocumented) semantics will no longer work.

RFC: [Fix "foreach" behavior](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php7_foreach)

### Changes to `list()`'s Behaviour

The `list()` function was documented as not supporting strings, however in few cases strings could have been used:
```PHP
// array dereferencing
$str[0] = 'ab';
list($a, $b) = $str[0];
echo $a; // a
echo $b; // b

// object dereferencing
$obj = new StdClass();
$obj->prop = 'ab';
list($a, $b) = $obj->prop;
echo $a; // a
echo $b; // b

// function return
function func()
{
    return 'ab';
}

list($a, $b) = func();
var_dump($a, $b);
echo $a; // a
echo $b; // b
```

This has now been changed making string usage with `list()` forbidden in all cases.

Also, empty `list()`'s are now a fatal error, and the order of assigning variables has been changed to left-to-right:
```PHP
$a = [1, 2];
list($a, $b) = $a;

// OLD: $a = 1, $b = 2
// NEW: $a = 1, $b = null + "Undefined index 1"

$b = [1, 2];
list($a, $b) = $b;

// OLD: $a = null + "Undefined index 0", $b = 2
// NEW: $a = 1, $b = 2
```

**BC Breaks**
 - Making `list()` equal to any non-direct string value is no longer possible.
   `null` will now be the value for the variable `$a` and `$b` in the above
examples
 - Invoking `list()` without any variables will cause a fatal error
 - Reliance upon the old right-to-left assignment order will no longer work

RFC: [Fix list() behavior inconsistency](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/fix_list_behavior_inconsistency)

RFC: [Abstract syntax tree](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/abstract_syntax_tree)

### Changes to Division by Zero Semantics

Prior to PHP 7, when a divisor was 0 for either the divide (/) or modulus (%) operators,
an E_WARNING would be emitted and `false` would be returned. This was nonsensical for
an arithmetic operation to return a boolean in some cases, and so the behaviour has been
rectified in PHP 7.

The new behaviour causes the divide operator to return a float as either +INF, -INF, or
NAN. The modulus operator E_WARNING has been removed and (alongside the new `intdiv()`
function) will throw a `DivisionByZeroError` exception. In addition, the `intdiv()`
function may also throw an `ArithmeticError` when valid integer arguments are supplied
that cause an incorrect result (due to integer overflow).

```PHP
var_dump(3/0); // float(INF) + E_WARNING
var_dump(0/0); // float(NAN) + E_WARNING

var_dump(0%0); // DivisionByZeroError

intdiv(PHP_INT_MIN, -1); // ArithmeticError
```

**BC Breaks**
 - The divide operator will no longer return `false` (which could have been silently coerced
 to 0 in an arithmetic operation)
 - The modulus operator will now throw an exception with a 0 divisor instead of returning `false`

RFC: No RFC available

### Fixes to Custom Session Handler Return Values

When implementing custom session handlers, predicate functions from the
`SessionHandlerInterface` that expect a `true` or `false` return value did not
behave as expected. Due to an error in the previous implementation, only a `-1`
return value was considered false - meaning that even if the boolean
`false` was used to denote a failure, it was taken as a success:
```PHP
<?php

class FileSessionHandler implements SessionHandlerInterface
{
    private $savePath;

    function open($savePath, $sessionName)
    {
        return false; // always fail
    }

    function close(){return true;}

    function read($id){}

    function write($id, $data){}

    function destroy($id){}

    function gc($maxlifetime){}
}

session_set_save_handler(new FileSessionHandler());

session_start(); // doesn't cause an error in pre PHP 7 code
```

Now, the above will fail with a fatal error. Having a `-1` return value will
also continue to fail, whilst `0` and `true` will continue to mean success. Any
other value returned will now cause a failure and emit an E_WARNING.

**BC Breaks**
 - If boolean `false` is returned, it will actually fail now
 - If anything other than a boolean, `0`, or `-1` is returned, it will fail and cause a warning to be emitted

RFC: [Fix handling of custom session handler return values](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/session.user.return-value)

### Deprecation of PHP 4-Style Constructors

PHP 4 constructors were preserved in PHP 5 alongside the new `__construct()`.
Now, PHP 4-style constructors are being deprecated in favour of having only a
single method (`__construct()`) to be invoked on object creation. This is
because the conditions upon whether the PHP 4-style constructor was invoked
caused additional cognitive overhead to developers that could also be confusing
to the inexperienced.

For example, if the class is defined within a namespace or if an
`__construct()` method existed, then a PHP 4-style constructor was recognised
as a plain method. If it was defined above an `__construct()` method, then an
E_STRICT notice would be emitted, but still recognised as a plain method.

Now in PHP 7, if the class is not in a namespace and there is no
`__construct()` method present, the PHP 4-style constructor will be used as a
constructor but an E_DEPRECATED will be emitted. In PHP 8, the PHP 4-style
constructor will always be recognised as a plain method and the E_DEPRECATED
notice will disappear.

**BC Breaks**
 - Custom error handlers may be affected by the raising of E_DEPRECATED
   warnings. To fix this, simply update the class constructor name to
`__construct`.

RFC: [Remove PHP 4 Constructors](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_php4_constructors)

### Removal of date.timezone Warning

When any date- or time-based functions were invoked and a default timezone had
not been set, a warning was emitted. The fix was to simply set the
`date.timezone` INI setting to a valid timezone, but this forced users to have
a php.ini file and to configure it beforehand. Since this was the only setting
that had a warning attached to it, and it defaulted to UTC anyway, the warning
has now been removed.

RFC: [Remove the date.timezone warning](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/date.timezone_warning_removal)

### Removal of Alternative PHP Tags

The alternative PHP tags `<%` (and `<%=`), `%>`, `<script language="php">`, and
`</script>` have now been removed.

**BC Breaks**
 - Code that relied upon these alternative tags needs to be updated to either
   the normal or short opening and closing tags. This can either be done
   manually or automated with [this porting script](https://gist.github.com/nikic/74769d74dad8b9ef221b).

RFC: [Remove alternative PHP tags](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_alternative_php_tags)

### Removal of Multiple Default Blocks in Switch Statements

Previously, it was possible to specify multiple `default` block statements
within a switch statement (where the last `default` block was only executed).
This (useless) ability has now been removed and causes a fatal error.

**BC Breaks**
 - Any code written (or more likely generated) that created switch statements
   with multiple `default` blocks will now become a fatal error.

RFC: [Make defining multiple default cases in a switch a syntax error](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/switch.default.multiple)

### Removal of Redefinition of Parameters with Duplicate Names

Previously, it was possible to specify parameters with duplicate names within a function definition.
This ability has now been removed and causes a fatal error.

```PHP
function foo($version, $version)
{
    return $version;
}

echo foo(5, 7);
  
// Pre PHP 7 result
7

// PHP 7+ result
Fatal error: Redefinition of parameter $version in /redefinition-of-parameters.php
```

**BC Breaks**
 - Function parameters with duplicate name will now become a fatal error.

### Removal of Dead Server APIs

The following SAPIs have been removed from the core (most of which have been moved to PECL):
- sapi/aolserver
- sapi/apache
- sapi/apache_hooks
- sapi/apache2filter
- sapi/caudium
- sapi/continuity
- sapi/isapi
- sapi/milter
- sapi/nsapi
- sapi/phttpd
- sapi/pi3web
- sapi/roxen
- sapi/thttpd
- sapi/tux
- sapi/webjames
- ext/mssql
- ext/mysql
- ext/sybase_ct
- ext/ereg

RFC: [Removal of dead or not yet PHP7 ported SAPIs and extensions](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/removal_of_dead_sapis_and_exts)

### Removal of Hex Support in Numerical Strings

A Stringy hexadecimal number is no longer recognised as numerical.
```PHP
var_dump(is_numeric('0x123'));
var_dump('0x123' == '291');
echo '0x123' + '0x123';

// Pre PHP 7 result
bool(true)
bool(true)
582

// PHP 7+ result
bool(false)
bool(false)
0
```

The reason for this change is to promote better consistency between the
handling of stringy hex numbers across the language. For example, explicit
casts do not recognise stringy hex numbers:
```PHP
var_dump((int) '0x123'); // int(0)
```

Instead, stringy hex numbers should be validated and converted using the `filter_var()` function:
```PHP
var_dump(filter_var('0x123', FILTER_VALIDATE_INT, FILTER_FLAG_ALLOW_HEX)); // int(291)
```

**BC Breaks**
 - This change affects the `is_numeric()` function and various operators, including `==`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `++`, and `--`

RFC: [Remove hex support in numeric strings](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_hex_support_in_numeric_strings)

### Removal of Deprecated Functionality

All Deprecated functionality has been removed, most notably:
 - The original mysql extension (ext/mysql)
 - The ereg extension (ext/ereg)
 - Assigning `new` by reference
 - Scoped calls of non-static methods from an incompatible `$this` context
   (such as `Foo::bar()` from outside a class, where `bar()` is not a static
method)

**BC Breaks**
 - Any code that ran with deprecation warnings in PHP 5 will no longer work (you were warned!)

RFC: [Remove deprecated functionality in PHP 7](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_deprecated_functionality_in_php7)

### Reclassification and Removal of E_STRICT Notices

E_STRICT notices have always been a bit of a grey area in their meaning. This
changes removes this error category altogether and either: removes the E_STRICT
notice, changes it to an E_DEPRECATED if the functionality will be removed in
future, changes it to an E_NOTICE, or promotes it to an E_WARNING.

**BC Breaks**
 - Because E_STRICT is in the lowest severity error category, any error
   promotions to an E_WARNING may break custom error handlers

RFC: [Reclassify E_STRICT notices](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/reclassify_e_strict)

### Deprecation of Salt Option for `password_hash()`

With the introduction of the new password hashing API in PHP 5.5, many began
implementing it and generating their own salts. Unfortunately, many of these
salts were generated from cryptographically insecure functions like mt_rand(),
making the salt far weaker than what would have been generated by default.
(Yes, a salt is always used when hashing passwords with this new API!) The option to
generate salts have therefore been deprecated to prevent developers from
creating insecure salts.

RFC: no RFC available

### Error on Invalid Octal Literals

Invalid octal literals will now cause a parse error rather than being
truncated and silently ignored.

```PHP
echo 0678; // Parse error:  Invalid numeric literal in...
```

**BC Breaks**
 - Any invalid octal literals in code will now cause parse errors

RFC: no RFC available

### `substr()` Return Value Change

`substr()` will now return an empty string instead of `false` when the start
position of the truncation is equal to the string length:
```PHP
var_dump(substr('a', 1));

// Pre PHP 7 result
bool(false)

// PHP 7+ result
string(0) ""
```

`substr()` may still return `false` in other cases, however.

**BC Breaks**
 - Code that strictly checked for a `bool(false)` return value may now be
 semantically invalid

RFC: no RFC available

## FAQ

### What happened to PHP 6?

PHP 6 was the major PHP version that never came to light. It was supposed to
feature full support for Unicode in the core, but this effort was too ambitious
with too many complications arising. The predominant reasons why version 6 was
skipped for this new major version are as follows:
 - **To prevent confusion**. Many resources were written about PHP 6 and much
   of the community knew what was featured in it. PHP 7 is a completely
different beast with entirely different focuses (specifically on performance)
and entirely different feature sets. Thus, a version has been skipped to
prevent any confusion or misconceptions surrounding what PHP 7 is.
 - **To let sleeping dogs lie**. PHP 6 was seen as a failure and a large amount
   of PHP 6 code still remains in the PHP repository. It was therefore seen as
best to move past version 6 and start afresh on the next major version, version
7.
